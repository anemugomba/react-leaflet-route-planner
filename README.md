The app will calculate the optimal route between the origin and destination and return the travel time, distance, and route geometry. You can also configure various parameters such as the transportation mode, unit of measurement, departure time, avoidances, and vehicle profile when selecting a truck as the transportation mode. Some of the features are coming soon.
